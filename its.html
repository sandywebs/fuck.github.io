      <h3>Short Fiml Making</h3>
   </div>

<div class="st1">
   <h3>Rules :</h3>
   <p>For a short film competition, the shorter the better in some cases. Most of the time, a short film competition will require that the films entered be under 15 minutes.</p>
   <p>Make sure that you are submitting a film that falls within the time. And total length guidelines for the competition that you’re entering. You don’t want to get disqualified from the start.</p>
   <p>Keep in mind that there may also be a minimum duration that is acceptable, too. For example, most short film competition rules and regulations for independent film producers state that the minimum length of the film must be at least 120 seconds.</p>
   <h3>PRODUCTION COMPLETION DATE :</h3>
   <p>short films that are entered into a competition must have been completed in a month. As in one month, prior to the entry being submitted.</p>
   <p>Overall, short films will need to have been filmed and produced in the very recent time period leading up to the competition. Generally no more than four weeks prior to the event.</p>
   <h3>FORMAT :</h3>
   <p>Films you submit to a short film competition are going to need to be in the format the particular competition accepts. Most competitions require films to be shot in MPEG4 format or AVI format.</p>
   <p>Check with the film competition guidelines or rules FAQs to determine recommendations or requirements for particular aspect ratios for your submission. There’s a general recommendation that films have a ratio of 16:9 but this could vary.</p>
   <p>Note that it is highly likely that the competition will require your submission to be provided in digital format. Rather than in the form of a Blu-ray, DVD, or HD-CAM format.</p>
   <p>You must be able to provide your film submission in whatever format is required by the competition. No exceptions.</p>
   <h3>RIGHTS & CLEARANCE :</h3>
   <p>Copyright rules are incredibly important when entering a short film competition. Rules and regulations may vary as to the extent. Upon which the event coordinator will require you to prove copyright clearance.</p>
   <p>But you can expect that at a minimum, the coordinator expects you to have done your own due diligence in acquiring the permissions. And appropriate rights licenses to any copyrighted content that you’ve used during the course of producing your short film.</p>
   <h3>SUPPLYING PROOF:</h3>
   <p>You should prepare to prove that you have the right to any music, songs, script, or trademark elements that you utilize in your production. Even if you’ve read the short film competition rules and regulations.</p>
   <p>To see that they state that you will not be required to supply proof that you have applied for a copyright license for material that you’ve used in the creation of your short film.</p>
   <p>You should still perform due diligence in obtaining these rights. Because it’s the right thing to do. And because this is a requirement for distribution.</p>
   <h3>FAIR USE :</h3>
   <p>Regardless of whether you have used the copyrighted material in a fair use manner or not. You will be responsible for providing your defense in such a situation. However, in submitting your work to the short film competition.</p>
   <p>You will likely sign a waiver that states that you either have the licenses to copyright material in your film. Or that you have used copyrighted material in fair use. And performed due diligence in adequately proving such use ahead of time. </p>
   <h3>IN SUMMARY :</h3>
   <p>Make sure that if you are going to submit a short film which you’ve previously submitted. You do so only upon reading the short film competition rules and regulations. To ensure you’ve followed all expected rules regarding submitting previously submitted content.</p>
